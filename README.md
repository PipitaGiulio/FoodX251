# FoodX-251 Classification Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project explores **food image classification** on the [FoodX-251 dataset](https://research.fb.com/foodx-251/) using two different approaches:  

1. **Supervised Learning** â€“ A custom CNN trained directly on labeled data.  
2. **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)** â€“ A contrastive learning approach (SimCLR-style) followed by fine-tuning on downstream classification.  

The goal is to compare both methods, highlight trade-offs, and analyze how supervision impacts generalization on fine-grained food categories.
